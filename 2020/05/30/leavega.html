I am not exactly a nice person… actually I am always asking for more to my students. But Lea did not 
need any “encouragment” (Do you see my terrible smile?). For example, once Dr. Paul Gader came to visit

<p>Actually, it was nice to see that a deep analysis of the problem can outperform the simple application of
massive data.</p>

<p>So, yesterday, she was finally able to present, online the first one at Cinvestav, her graduation exam, making

quite happy, and now new arise from this. Two good news are</p>

<ol>
  <li>We are planning to post her code, so anybody can repeat her experiments.</li>
  <li>
