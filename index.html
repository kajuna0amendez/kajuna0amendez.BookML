<p>He has participated in several projects for the USA Army, Mexican Air Force, Oracle MDC, IBM Mexico, and several startups. As a consultant in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, his main task is to propose, design and develop algorithms for specific solutions to be implemented in final production code. Additionally, he is an associate research professor at Cinvestav Guadalajara where he leads a Machine Learning Research Group. He got his PhD in Computer Engineering doing Machine Learning at the University of Florida, USA.</p>
