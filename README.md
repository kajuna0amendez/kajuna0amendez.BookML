# Notes in Machine Learning
These are my attempts to write a series on the topic of ML. There are several important subjects  
I want to cover and depeen given the new advances in the area:

1. The Basic Ideas of Learning
  + Some of the basic ideas on Learning 
2. Linear Models
  + A basic introduction to Linear models
  + Some Basic ideas on regularization
  + Interluedes with Linear Algebra and Calculus
3. Regularization
  + A deeper study in the field of regularization
4. Gradient Descent 
  + Batch Gradiente Descent
  + Accelerating Gradient Descent
  + Stochastic Gradient Descent
  + Regret in M
5. Logistic Regression 
  + Interlude with Generative vs Discriminative models
  + The Logistic Regresion model
  + Acceleraiting the logistic regression
6. Feature Selection
  + Introduction to the curse of dimensionality
  + Methods for Subset Selection
  + Shrinkage methods
7. Feature Generation
  + Introduction
  + Principal Component Analysis
  + Singular Value Decomposition
  + Space Enbedding
7. Introduction to Bayes Classification
  + Naive Bayes
  + Discriminative Functions
8. Maximum a Posteriori Methods
  + The general case
  + Expectation Maximization Algorithm
