# Andres Mendez Vazquez
He has participated in several projects for the USA Army, Mexican Air Force, Oracle MDC, IBM Mexico, and several startups. As a consultant in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, his main task is to propose, design and develop algorithms for specific solutions to be implemented in final production code. Additionally, he is an associate research professor at Cinvestav Guadalajara where he leads a Machine Learning Research Group. He got his PhD in Computer Engineering doing Machine Learning at the University of Florida, USA.
## Notes in Machine Learning
These are my attempts to write a series on the topic of ML. There are several important subjects  
I want to cover and depeen given the new advances in the area:

1. The Basic Ideas of Learning
  + Some of the basic ideas on Learning 
2. Linear Models
  + A basic introduction to Linear models
  + Some Basic ideas on regularization
  + Interluedes with Linear Algebra and Calculus
3. Regularization
  + A deeper study in the field of regularization
4. Gradient Descent 
  + Batch Gradiente Descent
  + Accelerating Gradient Descent
  + Stochastic Gradient Descent
  + Regret in ML
5. Logistic Regression 
  + Interlude with Generative vs Discriminative models
  + The Logistic Regresion model
  + Acceleraiting the logistic regression
6. Feature Selection
  + Introduction to the curse of dimensionality
  + Methods for Subset Selection
  + Shrinkage methods
7. Feature Generation
  + Introduction
  + Principal Component Analysis
  + Singular Value Decomposition
  + Space Enbedding
7. Introduction to Bayes Classification
  + Naive Bayes
  + Discriminative Functions
8. Maximum a Posteriori Methods
  + The general case
  + Expectation Maximization Algorithm
